# LSST Axions
LSST probes of axion physics. These repo currently focuses on stellar probes of axion physics via alterations to stellar evolution from anamolous energy loss. Mechanisms include (but are certainly not limited to):

* White dwarf luminosity function
* Maximum luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch
* Ratio of horizontal branch to red giant branch stars
* Neutron star cooling.
